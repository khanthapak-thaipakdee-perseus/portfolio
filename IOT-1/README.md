# Design and Develop Shell Script to Receive Temperature and Humidity Using MQTT Protocol

In this assignment, an IoT solution based on M2M communications was designed and developed using the MQTT protocol. This solution enables an MQTT subscriber to independently acquire information from an MQTT publisher via an MQTT broker. The message comprised temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor module. A shell script was created using shell commands to ensure that the program completed all tasks in the assignment and to prevent users from executing the program with invalid inputs. This assignment was conducted on the IoT testbed and was part of the ELEC423 course, "The Internet of Things: Architecture and Applications" , in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool.
