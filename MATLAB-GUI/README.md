# MATLAB Graphic User Interface (GUI) for Electrical Data
In this assignment, it is imperative to develop a MATLAB GUI program designed to extract coordinate values from a text file and perform the necessary processing. The program should exhibit the following functionalities:

- Prompt the user to specify the file name from which the data will be retrieved.
- Graphically represent two time-resolved electrical signals, namely the high voltage signal "Uapp" extracted from the "Uapp.txt" file and the charge "Q" extracted from the "Uc.txt" file, with the x-axis and y-axis.
- Calculate various parameters for both signals, including peak-to-peak amplitude, root mean square (RMS) value, frequency, minimum value, and maximum value.
- Illustrate the Lissajous figure (Q-U) and apply a smoothing operation.
- Compute and present the discharge power.

This assignment was part of the ELEC431 course, "Engineering Programming" , in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool.
