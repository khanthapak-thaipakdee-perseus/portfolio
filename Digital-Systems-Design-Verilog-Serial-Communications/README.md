# Design and Implementation of Serial Communications Using Verilog
This project focuses on designing UART and IR communication systems in Verilog on the DE2 board, utilizing the RS232 interface. UART, a crucial component in serial communication, is implemented using Verilog to manage tasks such as data transmission, reception, and precise timing. Key components like counters, shift registers, baud rate generators, RX-TX controllers, and a 7-segment display are employed to ensure seamless data transfer between the DE2 board and external devices, with the 7-segment display used for both sending and receiving parts to verify the accuracy of the results. Additionally, IR communication is integrated using the HSDL-3201 module for wireless transmission, enhancing the system's versatility. The project also includes parity check and framing error detection, which are displayed using LEDs on the DE2 board, ensuring robust error handling and communication reliability. The system is tested and validated using terminal software like "Putty" to display transmitted ASCII values.

This assignment was part of the ELEC473 course, "Digital Systems Design" , in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool.
