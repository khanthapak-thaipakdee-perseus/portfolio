Assignment_1_full_system contains:

-Full system design with uniform random number generation.


Assignment_1_3_PID_Tuning contains:

- Open-loop response using the Ziegler-Nichols Method for PID tuning.
- Combination of velocity profiles.
- One cycle of the output signal (velocity and current).
- Step response of the PID controller + DC motor system.


Output folder contains:

- Current and velocity responses for different Kp, Ki, Kd values (some figures are not used in the report).


Seed-Output folder contains:

- Output (input feedback, current, velocity, position) simulations for 0.5 kg, 1 kg, and missing box events, with different seeds (seed1 - seed16). 
The probabilities in the report were calculated from this data.
