# Design and Implementation of LoRaWAN-Based IoT Application with ABP Activation for Transmitting and Receiving Messages to/from TTN
In this assignment, an IoT solution will be crafted using the IoT kit with Raspberry Pi OS. The emphasis lies in employing the LoRa physical layer protocol for long-distance communication, alongside the LoRaWAN protocol implemented by TTN. The chosen activation method is ABP, ensuring a secure activation process. Messages will be formatted using Cayenne LPP for efficient sensor data encapsulation. This IoT solution will seamlessly transmit temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor module, along with a specific numerical output, over the LoRaWAN network. This assignment was conducted on the IoT testbed and was part of the ELEC423 course, "The Internet of Things: Architecture and Applications," in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool.
