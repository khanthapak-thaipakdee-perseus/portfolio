# Design and Implementation of a MIPS Processor
This project involves designing a MIPS processor module and implementing digital systems using Verilog HDL, divided into three parts. Part A focuses on modifying a MIPS assembly language program to display the last 8 digits of the studentâ€™s university ID on the 7-segment displays of the DE2 board. This is demonstrated with SignalTap Logic Analyzer screenshots showing the instruction and program counter. Part B extends the MIPS processor by implementing additional instructions: XOR, XORI, and LBU. Part C includes designing a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) unit to drive an LED. The PWM is controlled by the MIPS processor via a register and adjusts the LED brightness based on the comparison between a counter and a register value. The LEDR5 is reassigned to the PWM unit, distinct from the existing GPIO, for precise control.
